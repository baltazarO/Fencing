This testing software will help users identify and remember what actions beat certain other actions in Olympic Saber Fencing. The goal is for fencers to use this so he or she can remember immediately how to change tactics in a saber fencing match.

Fencing is a lot like rock paper scissors. That is, everything has a counter action or move that beats it. Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper. There are many moves in fencing that an opponent may use. Thus, it is important to immediately know how to beat those moves, especially if there is a trend.
